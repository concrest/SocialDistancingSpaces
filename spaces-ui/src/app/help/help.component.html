    <h1>What's this for?</h1>
    <p>
        The <a routerLink="">map</a> shows spaces that are colour coded based on the following:
    </p>
    <h2 class="green">Green</h2>
    <p>
        These spaces are very easy to maintain a good social distancing. They are open spaces, or paths wide enough to pass each other with little to no risk to yourself, your family, and others
    </p>
    <h2 class="amber">Amber</h2>
    <p>
        These spaces might be a little risky for maintaining a good social distance, for example pavements or narrow paths with few passing places.  It may be awkward to pass each other safely
    </p>
    <h2 class="red">Red</h2>
    <p>
        These spaces are difficult or risky to maintain a good social distance, for example narrow pavements with little or no visibility of oncoming traffic. Approach these places with caution
