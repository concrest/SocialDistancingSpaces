# Social Distancing Spaces

How many people really know their local area well enough to exercise and maintain safe social distancing?  There are narrow paths that make it difficult to keep a safe distance away, and pavements where we have to step into the road. This service aims to record those risky places - if you know where they are you can approach with caution, or avoid altogether.

This project also aims to record the safe places - those places where there is plenty of room for us all.

## Status - Proof-of-concept

There's a demo hosted here: https://social-spaces.azurewebsites.net/

It's hosted on a Dev/Test App Plan at the moment, so probably won't be able to handle masses of traffic.

On the todo list, in no particular order:

- Search for a location
- Go to my location (using browser geolocation)
- Satellite view as an option on the map
- Styling update (the colours don't currently stand out much from the default street map)
- Contribute new spaces
- Suggest changes to existing spaces (e.g. the area, risk category, descriptions)

## Contributions

I'm a novice with Angular and Typescript, so I welcome contributions of all kinds.  If you do have something to contribute, please raise a GitHub issue about what you're intending before you start work.
